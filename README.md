## Getting Started

To run this application locally you'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed - [here](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html) is a useful guide for getting these up and running.

This project utilises Yarn for its package management (see [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install/) for installation) however feel free to use NPM if you find this more suitable.

Once you've cloned this repo to your local you can install all the required packages by running:

```bash
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

Before you run this application you'll need to create a `.env` file in the root folder and add the environment variables. Please request these directly from the developer.

Once you've added the `.env` file you can run these commands to start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```
